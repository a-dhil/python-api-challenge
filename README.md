Output data folder has all the output figures.

# Summary

In this challenge over 500 cities weather data was analyzed of varying distance from equator.The relationships between  was studied:-

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

# Acknowledgement
In this assignment i used vaarious tools to get the results and verify my analysis. I worked with github folder but my api key did not work for some reason. Then I worked on regular folder on my laptop, once i complte than I pasted the code on git hub folder this time it worked. Once I had the code ready and was not sure if the outcome is correct I would ask chatGpt to produce the outcome and verify. If i was not satisfied with the reslut then i contacted askBCS and my peers.
